Hints 1:

We need to use Sliding window Method to solve this Problem.

Add the elements, to currsum till it is less than S. If it becomes more than S, start deleting elements from start in the cuusum. if the currsum again becomes less than S, again start adding elements to it. In between also check, if the currsum becomes equal to S.
If yes, then output start and end index, else after traversing array no such solution is found, output -1.

The complete solution is in next hint.

Hints 2:

The complete solution is

Maintain start and last index to store and print these values 
Iterate the complete array.
Add array elements to cuursum
If currsum becomes greater than S, then remove elements starting from start index, till it become less than or equal to S, and increement start.
if currsum becomes equals to S, then print the starting and last index
if the currsum never maches to S, then print -1
